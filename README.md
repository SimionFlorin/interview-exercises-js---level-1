# Interview Exercises - Celestial Horizons

Welcome! This folder contains React exercises themed around the "Celestial Horizons" project (angel numbers, horoscopes, tarot readings).

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Option 1: Online (Recommended)
1.  Go to [CodeSandbox React Template](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-new).
2.  Create a new file for the exercise you are working on (e.g., `Exercise1.jsx`).
3.  Copy the code from the exercise file in this folder into your new CodeSandbox file.
4.  Import and use the component in `App.js`.

### Option 2: Local Setup
1.  Create a new React project:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app interview-practice
    cd interview-practice
    npm start
    ```
    *(Or use Vite: `npm create vite@latest`)*
2.  Copy the exercise files into your `src` folder.

### Before You Begin
1.  Open `reference-chat-example.jsx`.
2.  Review how `useState` and `useEffect` are used in that file. It serves as a guide for the coding style we look for.
